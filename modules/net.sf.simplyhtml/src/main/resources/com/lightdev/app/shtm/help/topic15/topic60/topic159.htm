      Creating and manipulating links
    </p>
    <p>
      A link in HMTL is a reference to another location and/or document a user 
      can jump to. See chapter '<a href="../../topic16/topic152/topic153.htm"> 
      Links in HTML</a>' for a technical description of links.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a link
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select a portion of text to format as link in the editor
      </li>
      <li>
        select 'Link...' from menu 'Format'
      </li>
      <li>
        make link settings as appropriate and
      </li>
      <li>
        press 'OK'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To change settings for an existing link
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        move the caret into text formatted as link
      </li>
      <li>
        select 'Link...' in menu 'Format'
      </li>
      <li>
        make link changes as appropriate and
      </li>
      <li>
        press 'OK'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With both selections above, a <a href="../../topic15/topic163/topic164.htm">
link dialog</a> is brought up to set link attributes accordingly. Once the 
      link dialog is completed, the previously selected text portion is 
      formatted as link accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: A link is only shown as link. It does not work as a link in 
      the way that the link target is shown when the link is clicked. This 
      probably will be added in a future stage.
