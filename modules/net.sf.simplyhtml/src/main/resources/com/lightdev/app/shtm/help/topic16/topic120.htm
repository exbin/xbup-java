      Stage 6: Lists
    </p>
    <p>
      The Java language already includes some standard actions to implement 
      list formatting with documents in a JEditorPane. These actions however 
      only provide a very basic approach to working with lists. On top of just 
      starting a new empty list and to enter text into this new list, for 
      application SimplyHTML the requirement is to offer a simple way of 
      switching list formatting on or off for an arbitrary portion of existing 
      text paragraphs. As well there should be a way to change formatting of 
      an existing list partly or completely through a separate dialog.
