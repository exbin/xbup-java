      Stage 10: HTML code editor and syntax highlighting
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML focuses on creation and manipulation of text documents. The 
      fact that the documents are stored as HTML files along with cascading 
      style sheets (CSS) was hidden from the user interface of SimplyHTML 
      intentionally. The autor should not be forced to know or work with HTML 
      code to write a text document.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, for an experienced user being familiar with HTML it 
      sometimes is quicker to manipulate a certain portion of HTML directly 
      instead of having to wade through GUI elements. For this reason this 
      stage of SimplyHTML implements a way to work on the HTML representation 
      of any given text document.
