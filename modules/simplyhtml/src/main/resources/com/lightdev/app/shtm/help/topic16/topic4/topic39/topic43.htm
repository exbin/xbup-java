      Adding online help
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an application is started by the user it is most convenient to 
      provide information and help directly out of that application. With 
      JavaHelp technology the Java language has an extension for online help 
      which any application can use to seamlessly incorporate documentation.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      JavaHelp extension
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaHelp extends the Java Runtime Environment in the way that it 
      provides a specification and platform to display any kind of 
      documentation. All Information presented in JavaHelp is stored in HTML 
      files. Table of contents, index and map are XML files all wrapped 
      together with the HTML topic files into a framework of classes to view 
      and query the information through a common user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the JavaHelp extension is not a part of the core Java 
      Runtime Environment (JRE) so the extension has to be applied manually by 
      coping the extension file for JavaHelp into the extensions directory of 
      the JRE.

      How to use JavaHelp in an application
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a JavaHelp documentation is set up by creating HTML documents, 
      table of contents, index and map files and the JavaHelp extension is 
      available to the JRE, displaying JavaHelp documentation simply is done 
      by creating a <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">HelpSet</font>
 object for the corresponding help set and display it with an instance of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
HelpBroker</font>.

      How help is created for SimplyHTML
    </p>
    <p>
      All documentation is stored in a single JavaHelp help set in directory <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
help</font> of the SimplyHTML class path (<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
source/com/lightdev/app/shtm/help</font>). The help set is the one you are 
      currently reading. It was produced entirely with the Java application 
      HelpExpert. HelpExpert is created by the author of SimplyHTML (hey, 
      that's me again!) and is available at

    <p class="heading2">
      How help is implemented in SimplyHTML
    </p>
    <p>
      A common practice is to deliver documentation through menu 'Help'. 
      Consequently SimplyHTML has an item 'Help Topics' in the 'Help' menu 
      linking to this help set. In stage 1 the link was performed by <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SHTMLHelpShowContentsAction</font>. This has been refined to now being handled 
      in method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">initJavaHelp</font>
 of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">FrmMain</font>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Method initJavaHelp
    </p>
    <p>
      In method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">initJavaHelp</font>
 an instance of a <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">HelpBroker</font>
 is created pointing to the JavaHelp version of this tutorial (included in the 
      Java archive (JAR) file of SimplyHTML). A reference to this <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
HelpBroker</font> is kept for later use. Then class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain's</font> instance of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
DynamicResource</font> is used to get the menu item meant for displaying the 
      application's online help topics overview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">CSH</font> (for 
      context sensitive help) of the JavaHelp API is used to create an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ActionListener</font> responsible to display context sensitive help on 
      occurrence of a given action (selecting the 'Help contents' menu item in 
      this case). This <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      ActionListener</font> is registered with the menu item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important</b>: A 'readme' document should always be distributed with 
      an application as <i>plain text file</i>. The readme file should contain 
      essential information to properly set up and run the application. If all 
      other tools fail, at least the user can be referred to this file to 
      start with.
