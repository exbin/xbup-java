      Working with HTML code
    </p>
    <p>
      For an experienced user being familiar with HTML it sometimes is quicker 
      to manipulate a certain portion of HTML directly instead of having to 
      wade through GUI elements. For this reason in stage 10 of application 
      SimplyHTML a way to work on the HTML representation of any given text 
      document is implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see and edit the HTML representation of a given text document
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="../../topic15/topic59.htm">open the document</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        click on the tab <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">HTML 
        code view</font> at the bottom of the editor pane
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The display will switch from layout view to HTML code view. In the HTML 
      code view the structural information for a particular document is shown 
      along with its content. Tags and attributes are mixed with plain text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML code view does not show how the plain text will look. Instead 
      it highlights the structural portions of HTML and allows to work on the 
      HTML code.
    </p>
    <p>
      All changes to the HTML code are transformed to the resulting layout 
      automatically when switching back to layout view (clicking on tab <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
Layout view</font> at the bottom of the editor pane, that is).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important</b>: To work on HTML code should only be done by users 
      being experienced in HTML use. Changing HTML code can destroy the 
      structure of the document leading to unpredictable results in the layout 
      of respective document and even loss of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: With bigger documents it can take a short while to display 
      the HTML code initially.
