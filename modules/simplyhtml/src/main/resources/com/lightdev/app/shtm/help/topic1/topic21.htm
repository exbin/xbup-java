      Release 2 of stage 9 published. This release is a major update with 
      enhancements to the way SimplyHTML handles HTML content. Release 2 
      focuses on a clearer distinction between HTML 3.2 and HTML 4. It lets 
      the user choose the HTML version SimplyHTML should use through the <a href="../topic15/topic163/topic167.htm">
options dialog</a>. Changes were made to the style sheet handling and the 
      plug-in architecture too.

      creation and manipulation of links and link anchors. Refines working 
      with paragraph styles and named styles by supporting tag types and 
      multiple styles for given tags in certain controls. Refines cut and 
      paste for nested paragraph tags. <a href="../topic16/topic34/topic115.htm">
Compensates</a> different display of font sizes between Java and Web Browsers. 
      Table rendering was enhanced. Selected dialogs have a button for context 
      sensitive help on the respective dialog. A new section <a href="../topic15/topic163.htm">
user interface</a> has been added to the tutorial for this purpose. The 
      application 'remembers' the directories of the file that was last opened 
      and saved.

      published pre-release 1 of stage 1 (source codes and javadoc 
      compilation). Wow, eight weeks went by and still no first release 
      finished. Let's at least share what we have so far. Because the tutorial 
      takes more time to write than the application itself and although the 
      tutorial is almoset done, this pre-release comes without the tutorial.
