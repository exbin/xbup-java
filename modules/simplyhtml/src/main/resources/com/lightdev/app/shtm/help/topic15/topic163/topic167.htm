      Options dialog
    </p>
    <p>
      The options dialog allows to set general preferences for application 
      SimplyHTML. All settings are persistently stored for each individual 
      user and reinstated when SimplyHTML is launched.

      Look and feel
    </p>
    <p>
      A feature of the Java[tm] platform is its 'pluggable look and feel' 
      concept. With this setting the user can select a look and feel from 
      those installed on the machine SimplyHTML is running on.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Write HTML files as HTML 3.2
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting this option causes SimplyHTML to create document files in HTML 
      3.2. This means that some features from later HTML versions are not 
      available such as certain CSS formats and HTML tags. Setting this option 
      is useful for environments that require HTML 3.2 such as JavaHelp.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Write HTML files as HTML 4
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting this option causes SimplyHTML to create documents in HTML 4. 
      This enables certain formatting features such as individual table 
      borders or background coloring for individual parts of text.

    <p class="heading2">
      Link new documents with default style sheet
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually a reference between a document and a style sheet containing 
      named styles is only created when <a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic139.htm">
named styles are added to a document explicitly</a>. In cases where a new 
      document shall use an existing style sheet which was previously created 
      for another document, this option can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting this option causes creation of a style sheet reference in 
      newly created documents linking to the default style sheet ('<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
style.css</font>'). File '<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"> 
      style.css</font>' always is created by SimplyHTML, when <a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic139.htm">
named styles are added to a document</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a new document is created with this option selected, the style 
      sheet reference to '<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"> 
      style.css</font>' is included in the new document upon creation even 
      without named styles being defined for the new document so far. The new 
      document has then to be saved to the directory where respective file '<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
style.css</font>' is already located for the styles from '<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
style.css</font>' to be in effect in the new document.
