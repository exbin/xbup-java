      Customizing Java for CSS
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we can look at how to build GUI and functionality for font 
      manipulation, we need to understand the way, HTML documents are handled 
      in Java a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As shown previously, text and HTML are used in a <a href="../../topic16/topic4/topic25.htm">
model-view-controller environment</a> consisting of EditorKit, Document and 
      EditorPane. However, up to Java 2 Standard Edition version 1.4 this 
      environment supports HTML 3.2 only. Especially it does not totally 
      support <a href="../../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic42.htm">CSS</a> 
      elements although attributes are stored partly in CSS format already.
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML is based on CSS for dealing with styles and font settings 
      belong to styles so consequently, font settings are implemented using 
      CSS as well.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Design approach
    </p>
    <p>
      In stage 3 of SimplyHTML font manipulation is enabled for a contiguous 
      run of characters. HTML has tag <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SPAN</font> to set font attributes for a contiguous run of characters using 
      CSS . In addition there are tags <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FONT</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">B</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
I</font> etc. allowign the same without using CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      In SimplyHTML universal usage of CSS has been chosen because almost any 
      part of a HTML structure can be formatted with CSS regardless of its 
      type.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Solution approach
    </p>
    <p>
      To show and manipulate font information for documents with SimplyHTML 
      using CSS on character level, support for the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SPAN</font> tag has to be built into the <a href="../../topic16/topic4/topic25.htm">
MVC environment</a> for HTML documents in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML does this by extending classes <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
HTMLDocument</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      HTMLDocument.HTMLReader</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
HTMLEditorKit</font> and <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      HTMLWriter</font> accordingly, as described in the next chapters.
