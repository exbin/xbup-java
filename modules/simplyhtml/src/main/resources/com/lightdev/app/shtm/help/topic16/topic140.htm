      Stage 8: Paragraph styles and named styles

      Paragraph styles
    </p>
    <p>
      In <a href="../topic16/topic74.htm">stage 3</a> of SimplyHTML font 
      manipulation was added to the application. Font settings are applied to 
      individual parts of a document down to single characters with this 
      functionality. With paragraph styles such settings can be applied to one 
      or more paragraphs in one step too. As well paragraph styles allow to 
      manipulate additional attributes such as alignment or margins.

      Named styles
    </p>
    <p>
      Named styles in turn are an elegant way to define styles that are 
      frequently used and store them in a separate <a href="../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic42.htm">
style sheet</a>. Usage of style sheets was already part of application 
      SimplyHTML since the <a href="../topic16/topic4.htm">first stage</a> 
      however this stage finally adds functionality to use style sheets to 
      their original purpose.
