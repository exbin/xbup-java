      Image dialog
    </p>
    <p>
      The image dialog is used to add images to a document and change 
      attribute settings for such image. It also allows to maintain the image 
      repository a document is associated to. See also chapter '<a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic135.htm">
Working with images</a>' about how images are applied to documents.

      Image files panel
    </p>
    <p>
      In panel image files all files are shown that are stored in the <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic129.htm">
image repository</a> that is associated to the currently edited document. 
      Clicking on one image file name listed in panel Image files shows the 
      image in panel Preview and lists image attributes in panel Properties.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Add
    </p>
    <p>
      Press button Add to add a new image file to the repository. A file 
      chooser dialog will appear to select a file from. The selected file is 
      copied into the image repository associated with the document and 
      displayed in pnale Image Files.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Delete
    </p>
    <p>
      Button Delete is used to remove a file from the image repository. 
      Respective file is permanently deleted from the directory used as an 
      image repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: All references to the deleted image in any document 
      associated to this image repository will be 'broken' when deleting an 
      image from the repository.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Preview panel
    </p>
    <p>
      Panel Preview displays an image selected in panel Image files. An image 
      is scaled to the current size of the preview area when initially 
      displayed. When image attributes are changed in panel Properties, the 
      image size changes accordingly. The size of the preview area remains 
      unchanged and scroll bars are shown when an image does not fit into the 
      preview area. The size of the preview area can be changed by resizing 
      the dialog window. In this case the image size remains the same and only 
      the size of the preview area changes along with the window size.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Properties panel
    </p>
    <p>
      In panel Properties attributes of the image currently displayed in panel 
      Preview are shown. Changes to image attributes in panel Properties 
      directly affect the image shown in panel Preview, i.e. the image changes 
      in size accordingly.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Scale
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this control to enter a value by which the size of the image is to 
      be scaled. Size is scaled proportionally, i.e. the relation of width and 
      height is always kept.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Width
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this control to set a width for the image. Height and scale are 
      adjusted accordingly.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Height
    </p>
    <p>
      Use this control to set a height for the image. Width and scale are 
      adjusted accordingly.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Horiz. Space
    </p>
    <p>
      This field can be used to set a value for space between the image and 
      objects on the left and right of the image.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Vert. Space
    </p>
    <p>
      This field can be used to set a value for space between the image and 
      objects on top and bottom of the image.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Alignment
    </p>
    <p>
      Alignment controls how the image is to be aligned relative to other 
      objects, i.e. an alignment setting of left aligns the image left of any 
      other objects. (This setting is modeled but not rendered in SimplyHTML)
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Border
    </p>
    <p>
      Set the width of a border around the image. A setting of 0 means no 
      border, any other value means a border around the image in the specified 
      width.
