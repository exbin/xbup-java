      Creating an 'About dialog'
    </p>
    <p>
      An elementary part of an application is its 'about' dialog. An 'about 
      dialog' usually is shown when the user likes to know which application 
      is currently running, by whom it was created, which version the user 
      operates, which terms and conditions are connected to usage, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is common practice to have an item in the help menu of an application 
      such as 'About SimplyHTML' for this purpose. This menu item in 
      application SimplyHTML creates an instance of its <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
AboutBox</font> class.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Class AboutBox
    </p>
    <p>
      Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">AboutBox</font> 
      descends from class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      JDialog</font> and hosts a number of information panels. In the upper 
      left part, an image associated with the application is shown (see 
      below). Next to the image on the right a number of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JLabels</font> have the application name, current release, the author (wow, 
      that's me!) and the application's home page. The name of the application 
      is taken from the constant <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
APP_NAME</font> of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      FrmMain</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below these components, a <a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic39/topic51.htm">
license panel</a> shows the full text of the <a href="../../../topic1/topic5.htm">
GNU General Public License</a> SimplyHTML is distributed under. Finally a 
      close button is displayed at the bottom of the dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">AboutBox</font> does not 
      have any other function than to construct itself and to be shown for 
      information. Once the close button is pressed, it is disposed properly. 
      This is ensured by overriding method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
processWindowEvent</font> and calling <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
enableEvents</font> in the constructor of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
AboutBox</font>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Reading an image from the class path
    </p>
    <p>
      A common way to display an image is to place a JLabel somewhere onto a 
      visible component and associate an image to it. <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JLabel</font> has a constructor especially for that, which accepts an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageIcon</font> object as a parameter. The image is taken from the class path 
      of application SimplyHTML, where file '<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
App.jpg</font>' is distributed together with the applciation's classes in 
      subdirectory '<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">image</font>
 '.
    </p>
    <p>
      Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">getResource</font>
       in the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">Class</font> 
      object of respective <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      JLabel</font> is used to create an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageIcon</font> object for file '<font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
App.jpg</font>'. Using the command <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
this.getClass.getResource(&quot;image/App.jpg&quot;)</font> gets the class 
      object of this <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">JLabel</font>
 object and finds out from where it was loaded. Calling <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
getResource</font> on this <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      Class</font> object resolves the name given as a parameter to <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
getResource</font> as a relative path to the path where the class was found.
