      Stage 9: Links
    </p>
    <p>
      In this stage creation and manipulation of links is implemented. While a 
      link seems to be a rather trivial element in an HTML document, working 
      with links without knowing how to to type in HTML code requires a quite 
      complex GUI. This is because links can have many different forms with 
      several exceptional handling of certain link types.
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow for links referencing certain parts inside a given document, a 
      way to edit so called link anchors is needed in addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides links and link anchors, stage 9 has some refined handling of 
      paragraph tags and named styles from previous stage. And last but not 
      least it compensates a somehow ugly effect of Java showing font sizes 
      smaller than any web browser.
