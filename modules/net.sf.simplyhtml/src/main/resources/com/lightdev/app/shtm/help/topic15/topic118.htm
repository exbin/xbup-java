      Using plug-ins
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML provides a mechanism to extend the main editing 
      functionalities of the application by external objects called 
      'plug-ins'. Plug-ins are installed by copying one or more plug-in files 
      into the directory SimplyHTML is installed in. Once installed, a plug-in 
      is loaded and activated inside SimplyHTML upon start of the application 
      by default.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Accessing plug-in functions
    </p>
    <p>
      Each plug-in provides an own menu in menu 'Plugin' of SimplyHTML where 
      all plug-in functionality is available. In addition there usually is a 
      menu item in the 'Help' menu having documentation on the plug-in.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access the functions of a plug-in
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        open menu 'Plugin'
      </li>
      <li>
        open the sub-menu for respective plug-in
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To access help information for a given plug-in
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        open menu 'Help'
      </li>
      <li>
        select the menu item referring to help for a given plug-in
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="heading2">
      Activating and de-activating plug-ins
    </p>
    <p>
      Loaded plug-ins can be activated or deactivated for each user 
      individually. As well the location where a plug-in is docked inside 
      SimplyHTML's main window can be changed. To change the settings of any 
      loaded plug-in
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select 'Manage plug-ins...' from menu 'Plugin'
      </li>
      <li>
        choose a plug-in from the list of loaded plug-ins
      </li>
      <li>
        adjust settings accordingly and
      </li>
      <li>
        press 'Close'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The settings are applied to respective plug-ins and are stored 
      individually for the user who made the changes. See <a href="../topic16/topic103.htm">
