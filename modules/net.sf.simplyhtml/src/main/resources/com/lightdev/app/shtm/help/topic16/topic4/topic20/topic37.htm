    </p>
    <p>
      This action will terminate the application and takes care of saving 
      possibly existing unsaved changes before. The application will only be 
      terminated, if all possibly open documents could successfully and safely 
      be closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure a safe termination of SimplyHTML, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SHTMLFileExitAction</font> fires an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic20/topic36.htm">
SHTMLFileCloseAll</a></font> action to safely close all possibly open 
      documents. It then checks whether or not documents are left open. If 
      yes, one or more documents could not be closed safely and the 
      application will not be terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To properly handle window close events, this action is used in method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic12/topic14.htm">
processWindowEvent</a></font> of FrmMain too.
