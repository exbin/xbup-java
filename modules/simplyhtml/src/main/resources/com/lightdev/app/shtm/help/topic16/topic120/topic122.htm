      Implementing list formatting in SimplyHTML
    </p>
    <p>
      As described in the <a href="../../topic16/topic120.htm">introduction of 
      stage 6</a>, to apply list formatting in SimplyHTML the requirement is 
      to offer a simple way to switch list formatting on or off for an 
      arbitrary portion of existing text paragraphs. As well there should be a 
      way to change formatting of an existing list partly or completely 
      through a separate dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      While parts of previous stages of SimplyHTML can be re-used to achieve 
      list formatting thorugh a dialog, a certain difficulty is to change an 
      arbitrary portion of existing text to list formatting because the 
      element structure of the existing document content has to be changed.

      Changing the element structure
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way to change the element structure of an HTML document which 
      is publicly available in the Java classes is to insert HTML code 
      replacing a given part of respective document. SimplyHTML uses class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SHTMLWriter</font> to synthesize HTML code as already done in <a href="../../topic16/topic86/topic95.htm">
table formatting</a>. The process is described in more detail in the <a href="../../topic16/topic120/topic123.htm">
following chapters</a>. Please see the source code of stage 6 for additional 
      details.
