      Stage 5: Plug-ins, user settings and dynamic resources
    </p>
    <p>
      While SimplyHTML concentrates completely on text processing for HTML/CSS 
      documents, it shall not be limited to creating and editing such 
      documents. By delivering a solid and powerful editor for single 
      documents it can be the basis for other functions too. Added 
      functionality however is not in the scope of SimplyHTML which is where a 
      plug-in mechanism comes into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      A plug-in mechanism could allow almost any extension to SimplyHTML while 
      preserving the original scope, leaving additional functions to potential 
      plug-ins. This stage implements such plug-in mechanism along with an 
      enhanced way of working with resource bundles suitable for plug-in 
      usage. To allow users to configure plug-ins individually, a simlpe way 
      of persistently storing user prefernces is implemented too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plug-in mechanism is created with the idea of future enhancements 
      according to the needs of plug-in developers. This is best done in an 
      evolutionary process which is why it is started in this stage instead of 
      waiting until <a href="../topic16/topic112.htm">additional edititing 
      functions</a> are finalized.
