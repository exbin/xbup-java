      Stage 2: Resource bundles and common edit functions
    </p>
    <p>
      While <a href="../topic16/topic4.htm">stage 1</a> has been a comparably 
      big step, stage 2 will be more concise. Here we have a look on how to 
      add resource bundles to a Java application and how they can be used. As 
      well we will add edit functions common to most applications:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        cascading undo and redo,
      </li>
      <li>
        cut and paste and
      </li>
      <li>
        drag and drop
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
