      Style sheets and HTML documents
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we start looking into how SimplyHTML implements the use of 
      Documents, we should spend some time on reviewing how HTML documents and 
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are related.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      What are CSS styles
    </p>
    <p>
      Styles in CSS syntax are an extension to 'plain' HTML that allow to 
      define attributes describing how HTML content should look. With styles 
      one can define that paragraphs should always have a 6pt margin at the 
      top for instance or that headlines always should be shown in red letters 
      of 18pt size using font Helvetica.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      How styles can be used
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML allows to combine content and styles all in one HTML file, for 
      example by means of adding <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
style</font> attributes to HTML tags. Another way is to store a <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
&lt;style&gt;</font> tag in the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
&lt;head&gt;</font> tag of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition it is possible to store styles in files separated from an 
      HTML file. Storing styles in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) has the 
      advantage that a set of common styles can be defined at a central 
      location serving as the basis for an arbitrary number of HTML files.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      How SimplyHTML uses styles
    </p>
    <p>
      In SimplyHTML a combination of styles defined separately in style sheets 
      and styles defined as attributes within HTML tags is implemented. 
      Whenever possible SimplyHTML avoids HTML tags such as <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
&lt;font&gt;</font> in favour of styles.
