      About SimplyHTML
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML is an application for text processing. It stores documents as 
      HTML files in combination with <a href="topic16/topic4/topic25/topic42.htm">
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>. The application combines text processing 
      features as known from popular word processors with a simple and generic 
      way to store textual information and styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML is not intended to be used as an editor for web pages in the 
      first place (although it can be used for this purpose with some 
      limitations too). Especially HTML and CSS produced by other applications 
      might or might not work with SimplyHTML, as other applications as well 
      have trouble with content not produced by themselves.

      The SimplyHTML Project
    </p>
    <p>
      The SimplyHTML project was started to build an application with above 
      features and to document, how this can be done. This is approached by 
      building SimplyHTML in several stages and by documenting all stages 
      thoroughly. Each stage is covering certain functionality making it 
      easier to concentrate on some of the many details such an application is 
      made of. Stages are described in this tutorial, which as well serves as 
      online help. Source codes are documented with Javadoc in addition.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Open Source
    </p>
    <p>
      All source code is openly available along with the application and can 
      be used to find out, how the application is working. Among serving for 
      above functions, SimplyHTML shall be an example for developers intending 
      to build applications with similar functionality. As well it can serve 
      as basis for other applications.
