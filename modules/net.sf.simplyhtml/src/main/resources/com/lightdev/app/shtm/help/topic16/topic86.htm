      Stage 4: Tables
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementing support for tables is a comparably complex task because 
      there are no special objects for a table, table row or table column 
      inside a HTML document. Each table part is represented by elements 
      hierarchically linked, each element having many attributes. Iterating 
      through all cells of a table column for instance needs a special way of 
      handling for this reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complicate things a little, there are only comparably limited ways to 
      manipulate table elements in a document in Java. An additional challenge 
      is to support table borders in Java because up to J2SE 1.4, table cell 
      rendering is not appropriate compared to existing text processors when 
      it comes to borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stage of SimplyHTML implements support for tables trying to solve 
      these limitations. In the follwing chapters is described how this is 
      done in more detail.

      Due to the complexity of the topic the documentation does not cover all 
      details of the resulting source code completely. The source code itself 
      should be taken in addition to understand how the implementation is 
      accomplished.
