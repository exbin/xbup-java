      Setting the element type
    </p>
    <p>
      A specialty of HTML is to have different element types for content of a 
      document separate from the content formatting. Element types could be 
      paragraph, link or a certain kind of heading. One can think of element 
      types being a way to distinguish certain structures in a document while 
      named styles are a way to differentiate between certain formats both 
      independent from each other.

    <p>
      Element types are applied to one or more paragraphs always. By default a 
      paragraph is of element type paragraph as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set another element type,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select one or more paragraphs in the editor pane
      </li>
      <li>
        choose an element type from the element type combo box in the tool bar
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Currently the following element types can be set
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        paragraph
      </li>
      <li>
        heading 1
      </li>
      <li>
        heading 2
      </li>
      <li>
        heading 3
      </li>
      <li>
        heading 4
      </li>
