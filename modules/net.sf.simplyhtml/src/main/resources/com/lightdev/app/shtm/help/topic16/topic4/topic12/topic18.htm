      Customizing the main window
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned in chapter '<a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic12/topic17.htm">
The class FrmMain</a>', this class is extending class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JPanel</font> by adding some extra fields and methods. To construct these 
      extras as well as to set up the way the window initially is displayed, 
      method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">customizeFrame</font>
 is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      After setting the window title and size, method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
customizeFrame</font> gets a reference to the windows content pane, and adds a 
      newly created instance of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
BorderLayout</font> to it. Finally it creates a new <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JTabbedPane</font> and adds it to the center of the content pane. As the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JTabbedPane</font> is the only component of the application's main window, it 
      covers all of its visible region except for the menu and title bar.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      JTabbedPane jtpDocs
    </p>
    <p>
      A reference to <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">FrmMain's</font>
 tabbed pane is kept in field <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      jtpDocs</font> as a central place for pointing to all documents open in 
      the main window. Whenever a document is created or opened, it is added 
      to <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">jtpDocs</font> for 
      display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">jtpDocs</font> is 
      a good place to look for a certain document. If the currently active 
      document shall be adressed for instance, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
jtpDocs.getSelectedIndex</font> points to the currently selected tab in the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JTabbedPane</font> and <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      jtpDocs.getComponentAt</font> fetches the component contained in this 
      tab, which in turn would be the currently active document.
