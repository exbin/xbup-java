      SHTMLFileCloseAction
    </p>
    <p>
      All actions implement method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
actionPerformed</font> which gets called automatically by components bound to 
      that action. Usually all functionality to be performed by an action goes 
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">SHTMLFileCloseAction</font>
 adds some flexibility to that approach by having an additional method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
closeDocument</font>. This method is called by the action's <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
actionPerformed</font> method on the currently active document so that 
      whenever the action is fired, the currently active document is safely 
      closed.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Method closeDocument
    </p>
    <p>
      With method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">closeDocument</font>
 an arbitrary document shown in the main window can be closed even if it is 
      not the currently active one. The method is declared public so that it 
      can be called and reused from other places simply by instantiating class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SHTMLFileCloseAction</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The method's main task is to ensure that a document is only closed, when 
      all of its contents are properly saved. It does this by
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        check, whether or not the particular document needs to be saved (if it 
        was newly created and/or contains unsaved changes, that is)
      </li>
      <li>
        if not, the document is closed
      </li>
      <li>
        if yes, the user is asked if the document shall be saved
      </li>
      <li>
        if the document shall be saved, it is saved by calling the appropriate 
        action class (perform a 'save' or 'save as')
      </li>
      <li>
        if the save was successful or if the user chose not to save changes, 
        the document is closed
      </li>
      <li>
        if the save was not successful or the user wanted to cancel, the 
        document is not closed
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In all cases, closing the document is done simply by removing the 
      respective DocumentPane from <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic12/topic17.htm">
FrmMain's</a></font> <a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic12/topic18.htm">
      jtpDocs</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Special case: save thread in progress
    </p>
    <p>
      As outlined in '<a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic20/topic49.htm"> 
      Using threads for lengthy operations</a>', saving a document among other 
      functions is set forth in an own thread. Any close operation has to 
      consider, that a save operation on a particular document could be in 
      progress at the time the user selects to close a document. Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
closeDocument</font> takes this into account by calling Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
scheduleClose</font> (see below) in cases where it detects a save operation 
      being in progress or where it caused a save operation itself while 
      attempting to close a document.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Method scheduleClose
    </p>
    <p>
      When a save operation is in progress on a document that is to be closed, 
      SimplyHTML has to wait for the save operation to finish because a 
      document may only be closed when it was saved successful. Whether or not 
      the save operation was successful can only be determined, once it 
      completely finishes, so in this case, the application has to wait with 
      closing until then.
    </p>
    <p>
      To block the application from other activities, method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
scheduleClose</font> creates a <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      Timer</font> thread and schedules a <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
TimerTask</font> with the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">Timer</font>
 . The <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">TimerTask</font> 
      periodically checks whether or not the save operation of the particular 
      document has finished with the help of field <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
saveInProgress</font> of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      DocumentPane</font>. If it has finished, the document is closed and the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
Timer</font> and <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">TimerTask</font>
 are disposed. If there was an error during the save operation, the document 
      remains open.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Design advantage
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantage of this design is that closing a document safely is 
      implemented only once. Still it can be reused either as action or as 
      method from anywhere in the application as done in <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic20/topic36.htm">
SHTMLFileCloseAllAction</a></font> or <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SHTMLFileExitAction</font> for instance.
