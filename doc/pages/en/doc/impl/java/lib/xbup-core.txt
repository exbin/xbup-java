====== XBUP Core Library ======

Core library provides set of interfaces and functions to support XBUP-encoded document's handling. It provides basic parsers, declarations and catalog access, basic types and support for serialization, streaming and remote procedure calls (RPC).

FIXME

===== Basic Interfaces =====

Library contains interfaces for document, block and type declarations.

==== Declarations and Basic Types ====

Declarations are included in "org.xbup.lib.core.block" package. 

===== Parsers =====

Implementation of pull and event parsers is included in core library in "org.xbup.lib.core.parser" package.

[[en:doc:protocol:parsers|See more about protocol parser.]]

Java implementation provides two ways how to process tokens. One way is via wide interface XBListener for level 0 which provides single method for each token type.

  public void begin(XBBlockTerminationMode terminationMode)
  public void attrib(UBNatural attribute)
  public void data(InputStream data)
  public void end()

For level 1, there is similar interface XBTListener, which also includes additional method for type:

  public void typeXBT(XBBlockType blockType)

Other way uses token classes as defined in "org.xbup.lib.core.parser.token" package and interfaces with single method.

  * For level 0:

  XBBeginToken, XBAttributeToken, XBDataToken, XBEndToken

  * For level 1:

  XBTBeginToken, XBTTypeToken, XBTAttributeToken, XBTDataToken, XBTEndToken

For different ways and directions of handling tokens there are defined interfaces for each case:



===== Serialization =====

Various ways how to perform conversion of object data to protocol and back are included in "org.xbup.lib.core.serial" package.


===== Streaming =====



==== Stream Event Processing ====

===== Framework and Catalog Access =====



TODO:

Note: You have to process content of data token (for example read InputStream) before receiving next token.
