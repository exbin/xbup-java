      Switching list formatting on or off
    </p>
    <p>
      When an HTML document initially is filled with content by typing text, 
      the content is not formatted as list. To reach list formatting for parts 
      of a document the user could
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        start list formatting and then type content in the form of list items 
        as needed or
      </li>
      <li>
        type in content and then switch on list formatting for the recently 
        typed paragraphs
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      While the first case is comparably easy to achieve, both cases require a 
      simple toggle functionality to switch list formatting on or off.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Basic approach
    </p>
    <p>
      Such list toggle functionality basically this is achieved by
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        detecting whether or not the required list formatting is present for a 
        given text portion
      </li>
      <li>
        if list formatting is present, switch list formatting <b>off</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        if list formatting is not present (or not present as required), switch 
        list formatting <b>on</b>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="heading2">
      Method toggleList
    </p>
    <p>
      Above scheme is implemented with method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
toggleList</font> in class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      SHTMLEditorPane</font>. Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
toggleList</font> finds out the parent element of a selected text portion. It 
      then uses method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">switchOn</font>
 to determine whether or not list formatting is already present in the 
      selection inside the parent element. If method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
switchOn</font> 'decides' to switch on list formatting (returns <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
true</font> that is), method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      toggleList</font> uses method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
listOn</font> to switch on list formatting. Otherwise list formatting is 
      turned off by calling method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
listOff</font>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Difficulties
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to here the solution sounds rather simple. In detail however, some 
      difficulty is contained in the way how existing list formatting is to be 
      changed. There are two cases we need to look at in more detail:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        list formatting is to be switched off for only parts of an existing 
        list
      </li>
      <li>
        list formatting is to be switched on for one or more lists having 
        mixed list formatting
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="heading3">
      Splitting lists
    </p>
    <p>
      The first case above requires to split an existing list into up to three 
      sections: The list remaining at the beginning of the selection, the 
      actual selection for which list formatting is to be switched off and the 
      list part possibly following the selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">listOff</font> 
      splits a list by iterating through all list items in three steps. In the 
      first step, it generates HTML for the list portion remaining unchanged 
      and creates a new list end tag at the start of the selection to mark the 
      start of the list split.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly it continues iterating through the list items belonging to the 
      selection generating HTML code with <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
&lt;li&gt;</font> tags removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally a new list start tag is created to mark the end of the split and 
      iteration is continued over the remaining portion of the original list 
      generating HTML code for the remaining list elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting HTML code is inserted into the document replacing the 
      'old' part.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Merging lists
    </p>
    <p>
      The second case above requires to merge different list formattings to 
      one new list formatting. In addition, possible list formatting preceding 
      or following the selection has to be split as described in the previous 
      paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">listOn</font> 
      merges lists by iterating through all list items and adjusts list start 
      and end tags, merging and splitting lists as needed. <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
&lt;li&gt;</font> start and end tags are inserted if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting HTML code is inserted into the document replacing the 
      'old' part.
    </p>
