      General concept for image support
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML images are separated from documents. Documents contain <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic134.htm">
references</a> to image files in the place where images should appear inside a 
      document. An <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic134.htm">image 
      reference</a> describes the location and name of respective image file 
      as well as how it is to be rendered. The actual images are stored 
      separately in image files and loaded dynamically when documents are 
      displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML supports <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic134.htm">image 
      references</a> by maintaining an image repository for each document. An 
      image repository in this context is a directory containing all images 
      referenced by a HTML document.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Restrictions
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep image maintenance simple, the following restrictions are used in 
      SimplyHTML
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        image files referenced from HTML documents are automatically placed 
        into directory <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">images</font>

      </li>
      <li>
        directory <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">images</font>
         is created automatically inside the directory, a HTML file is saved
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML has no support for creation or manipulation of image files as 
      in image editing software . Image files need to be present already to be 
      added to documents created or maintained with SimplyHTML.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Supported image formats
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML supports the following image file formats
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
      </li>
      <li>
        Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) format
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="heading2">
      Temporary storage
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow image processing for newly created documents (i.e. documents 
      not having been saved at the time images are added) a temporary 
      directory is maintained. The temporary storage is maintained 
      automatically by SimplyHTML in directory
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">[user 
      home]/SimplyHTML/temp/</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">[user home]</font> in 
      this context is the directory returned by the Java expression <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;)</font>. It is usually the directory 
      where a user logged in to a given system has all rights and where no 
      other user except for system administrators has access rights unless 
      explicitly granted by the owner or system administrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using directory <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">[user 
      home]</font> has the effect that every user has an own temporary storage 
      area.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Images in new documents
    </p>
    <p>
      For each newly created document a directory is created inside the 
      temporary directory named after the document,
    </p>
    <p>
      e.g. <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">[user 
      home]/SimplyHTML/temp/Untitled 1/</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If images are added to a document which has not been saved so far, 
      directory images is created inside the temporary directory,
    </p>
    <p>
      e.g. <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">[user 
      home]/SimplyHTML/temp/Untitled 1/images/</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a new document is saved, the image directory is copied from the 
      temporary storage to the directory the new document has been saved.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Images in existing documents
    </p>
    <p>
      If images are added to an existing document, respective image files are 
      stored in directory <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      images</font> inside the directory the document was loaded from. 
      Directory <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">images</font> 
      is created in the directory the document was loaded from by application 
      SimplyHTML when it is not already present an images are added to that 
      document.
