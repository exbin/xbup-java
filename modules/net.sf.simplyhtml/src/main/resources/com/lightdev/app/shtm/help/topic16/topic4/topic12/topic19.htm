      Adding a menu bar and menu items
    </p>
    <p>
      As class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">FrmMain</font> 
      defines the main window of application SimplyHTML it should present the 
      application's functions to the user. One way of doing this is to 
      maintain a menu bar and menu items. In class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain</font> this is done mainly in method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
constructMenu</font> which is called in <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain's</font> constructor.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Fields referring to menus and menu items
    </p>
    <p>
      Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">FrmMain</font> 
      holds a field for each menu and menu item in its menu bar. These fields 
      are visible to all methods within class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain</font>. By keeping fields referring to the menu structure it is 
      possible to influence appearance and behaviour of the menu structure 
      later on during the flow of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      To build a menu bar using the menu fields of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain</font>, the fields have to be initialized first. This is done at the 
      same time the fields are declared upon construction of a <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain</font> object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initialization is done by creating a new instance of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JMenu</font> and <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">JMenuItem</font>
 respectively on the line of code where that field is declared. Each menu item 
      gets associated with an instance of the <a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic20.htm">
action class</a> which is meant for handling selctions of the particular menu 
      item.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Method constructMenu
    </p>
    <p>
      The previously initialized menu fields of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain</font> are put together on a menu bar by method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
constructMenu</font>. The method first creates a new <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JMenuBar</font> object and then adds all previously initialized menus and menu 
      items to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It then adds a new <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      MenuListener</font> to the file menu object which takes care of 
      adjusting appearance of the file menu whenever it is selected. Finally 
      the new menu bar is associated with the main window by calling method 
      setJMenuBar, which was inherited from <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JFrame</font>.
