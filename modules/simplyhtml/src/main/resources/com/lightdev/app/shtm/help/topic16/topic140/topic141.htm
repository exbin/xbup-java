      Character attributes vs. paragraph attributes
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest way to apply a certain format to a portion of a HTML 
      document is to store HTML format attributes such as <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
b</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">i</font> or <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
align</font> with any tag to be formatted in the particular way. While this 
      approach is most flexible in terms of combination of such attributes, 
      plain HTML attributes allow only limited formatting compared to CSS 
      styles. As well this method adds a lot of formatting information to the 
      plain content of a document with much rendundancy in most cases.

      CSS attributes
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">style</font>
       attribute, CSS attributes such as <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
margin-top</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      padding-right</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      text-align</font>, etc. can be added to HTML tags instead. This method 
      opens additional formatting settings but it still requires attributes to 
      be stored with each tag having the same impact as HTML attributes.

    <p class="heading2">
      Paragraph styles
    </p>
    <p>
      To reduce the formatting overhead HTML and CSS attributes can be applied 
      to paragraph tags so that they are valid on any tag contained in such 
      paragraph.

      Style sheets with named styles

      The most flexibility and power however is reached with usage of <a href="../../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic42.htm">
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> in combination with a given HTML document. By 
      defining styles in a separate <a href="../../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic42.htm">
style sheet</a> groups of format attributes can be held independent from HTML 
      documents resulting in significant advantages
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        styles are defined only once avoiding rendundancies and increasing 
        maintainability
      </li>
      <li>
        styles can be shared over many documents again reducing redundancy and 
        maintenance efforts
      </li>
      <li>
        documents only need references to styles reducing storage space
      </li>
      <li>
        a predefined group of attributes can be applied in a single making 
        formatting faster
      </li>
    </ul>
