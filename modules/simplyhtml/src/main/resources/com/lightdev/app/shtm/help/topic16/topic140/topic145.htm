      Approach to work with paragraph and named styles
    </p>
    <p>
      As <a href="../../topic16/topic140/topic144.htm">pointed out</a>, style 
      manipulation functionality is already exisiting in the Java classes and 
      the previous stages of application SimplyHTML. What is needed in 
      addition is a GUI to visualize the existing styles and to let the user 
      add new, change existing or delete styles.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Dialog to manipulate styles
    </p>
    <p>
      Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../topic16/topic140/topic146.htm">
ParaStyleDialog</a></font> is added to SimplyHTML as a new component to 
      achieve this. Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      ParaStyleDialog</font> has two major functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        to manipulate any given paragraph style and
      </li>
      <li>
        to maintain all paragraph styles in a given style sheet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because both tasks require the same elements (components to reflect 
      settings of paragraph attributes), they are combined inside class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ParaStyleDialog</font> and made available as two separate operation modes of 
      the component.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Components to select named styles and alignment
    </p>
    <p>
      To make available existing named styles for paragraphs as defined in the 
      style sheet, class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../topic16/topic140/topic147.htm">
StyleSelector</a></font> is created. It shows all available named paragraph 
      styles and lets the user apply a given style to the currently selected 
      paragraph(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      A paragraph attribute which is used quite often is the text alignment 
      setting (left, center or right). For setting text alignmen in one step, 
      inner class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      ToggleFontAction</font> has been changed to class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ToggleAction</font> and can now can be used as a generic action to toggle 
      certain character and paragraph attributes including text aligment. The 
      new action is used by SimplyHTML's <a href="../../topic16/topic103/topic111.htm">
dynamic resource mechanism</a> to add respective <a href="../../topic16/topic140/topic149.htm">
toggle button</a> components to the tool bar.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Style sheet storage
    </p>
    <p>
      As stage 8 allows to change contents of a given style sheet, the way a 
      style sheet is saved has to be <a href="../../topic16/topic140/topic150.htm">
revised</a>. When a document is saved, SimplyHTML now recogniszes whether or 
      not a style sheet with the same name exists in the location where a 
      document is to be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a style sheet present already, it is merged with the style sheet to 
      be saved.
