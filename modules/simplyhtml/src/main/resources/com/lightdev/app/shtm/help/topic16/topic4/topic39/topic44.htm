      Creating source code documentation
    </p>
    <p>
      Source codes usually are documented by comments inserted at positions in 
      the code where the author thought an explanation of what is done there 
      might be needed or otherwise helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      If such comments are created following a certain syntax, they can be 
      translated to a set of API documentation files in HTML with the Javadoc 
      tool of the Java Software Development Kit. For details about Javadoc 
      please refer to page 'Javadoc 1.4 Tool' at <font color="#3333ff">
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/javadoc/index.html</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally it is a good idea and common practice to comment Java source 
      codes following Javadoc syntax as almost automatically there will be a 
      very transparent and thorough documentation of the sources openly 
      viewable with nothing more than a browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      With application SimplyHTML this has been done too, so there is a set of 
      API documentation files in directory <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
doc</font> of the <a href="../../../topic1/topic24.htm">SimplyHTML 
      distribution package</a>. By opening file <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
index.html</font> the documentation can be viewed with any browser.
