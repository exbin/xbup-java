====== XBUP Core Library ======

Core library provides set of interfaces and functions to support XBUP-encoded document's handling. It provides basic parsers, declarations and catalog access, basic types and support for serialization, streaming and access to framework service.

===== Basic Interfaces =====

Library contains interfaces for document, block and type declarations.

==== Declarations and Basic Types ====


===== Parsers =====

Implementation of pull and event parsers is included in core library.

[[en:doc:protocol:parsers|See more about protocol parser.]]

Java implementation provides two ways how to process tokens. One way is via wide interface XBListener (and XBTListener) which provides single method for each token type.

public void begin(XBBlockTerminationMode terminationMode) throws XBParseException;\\
public void attrib(UBNatural attribute) throws XBParseException;\\
public void data(InputStream data) throws XBParseException;\\
public void end() throws XBParseException;\\

Other way uses token classes as defined in "org.xbup.lib.core.parser.token" package and interfaces with single method.

You have to process content of data token (read InputStream) before receiving next token.

===== Serialization =====



===== Streaming =====

==== Stream Event Processing ====

===== Framework and Catalog Access =====
