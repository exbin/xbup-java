      Stage 3: Font manipulation and tool bars
    </p>
    <p>
      Most text processors have one essential functionality in common. They 
      allow to manipulate fonts in various ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically fonts can be set through a menu allowing to change all font 
      related settings for a certain portion of text at once. In addition, 
      there mostly is a tool bar to quickly change single font attributes such 
      as size or style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stage 3 of SimplyHTML is about adding font manipulation features. It 
      builds a font dialog to change a whole set of font related attributes 
      and it creates tool bars to access most functions of SimplyHTML 
      including new font formatting.
