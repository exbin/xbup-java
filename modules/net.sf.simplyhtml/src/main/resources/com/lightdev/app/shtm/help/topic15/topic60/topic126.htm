      Creating and manipulating lists
    </p>
    <p>
      Lists are a consecutive amount of paragraphs being displayed with a 
      symbol separating each paragraph at the beginning. There can be ordered 
      lists, which follow an order such as <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
1., 2., 3., 4.</font> or <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">a., 
      b., c., d.</font> and unordered lists following no specific order such 
      as lists with a bullet symbol at the beginning of each paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lists can be created in two ways
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        start list formatting and then type content in the form of list items 
        as needed or
      </li>
      <li>
        type in content and then switch on list formatting for recently typed 
        paragraphs
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="heading2">

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        place the caret to the position list formatting shall be switched on 
        or off or

    </p>
    <p>
      While typing text, the caret moves similar to a region not being 
      formatted as list. Pressing [Enter] while the caret is inside a list 
      will create a new list item after the item the caret is currently in.
