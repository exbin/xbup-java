      Adding a standard tool bar
    </p>
    <p>
      Already having all functions of SimplyHTML as actions connected to the 
      menu bar and having a method createToolBar with stage 3 of SimplyHTML as 
      described previously, creating additional tool bars is done with almost 
      no additional effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create an additional tool bar for standard actions such as create a 
      new document, open or save a document, for instance an additional tool 
      bar definition in the resource bundle has been prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The additional tool bar definition is read by calling <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
createToolBar</font> in method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      customizeFrame</font> of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
FrmMain</font>. The new standard tool bar then is added to the panel on top of 
      the main frame where our font formatting tool bar is located too.
