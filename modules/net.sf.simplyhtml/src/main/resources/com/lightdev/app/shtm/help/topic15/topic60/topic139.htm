      Creating and manipulating named styles
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic138.htm">previous chapter</a> 
      describes how a certain format can be applied to one or more paragraphs 
      at once. However, in many cases similar formats are applied to the 
      content over and over again. To reduce maintenance effort and storage 
      space, named styles can be defined for such formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Named styles are not applied directly to a document when created. 
      Instead they are saved to the style sheet of a document. To use named 
      styles two steps are necessary:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        define a named style by setting all its formatting attributes and 
        saving it to the style sheet
      </li>
      <li>
        select a portion of the document in the editor and pick a named style 
        for it from the style selector in the tool bar
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once a named style is saved in the style sheet, it will appear in the 
      style selector in the tool bar of SimplyHTML. It is necessary to define 
      named styles only once for a combination of document and style sheet. 
      The style sheet for a document is maintained automatically by SimplyHTML 
      and saved whenever a document is <a href="../../topic15/topic58.htm">
      saved</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Creating a named style
    </p>
    <p>
      To define and save a named style
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select 'Named style...' from menu 'Format'
      </li>
      <li>
        set formatting attributes in the paragraph style dialog accordingly
      </li>
      <li>
        select an <a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic160.htm">element type</a>
         for the new style (selector located above list of named styles)
      </li>
      <li>
        press button 'Save as...'
      </li>
      <li>
        enter a name for the style and press 'OK'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="standard">
      <b>Important</b>: Styles are created only for the <a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic160.htm">
element type</a> that is currently selected (paragraph, link, heading, etc.). 
      Only changed attributes are saved to the style sheet.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Changing a name style
    </p>
    <p>
      To change settings for an existing named style
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select 'Named style...' from menu 'Format'
      </li>
      <li>
        select the <a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic160.htm">element type</a>
 (selector located above list of named styles)
      </li>
      <li>
        select the named style to change settings for in the list of existing 
        named styles
      </li>
      <li>
        change formatting attributes in the paragraph style dialog accordingly
      </li>
      <li>
        switch back to the 'Paragraph' tab if you are on tab 'Font'
      </li>
      <li>
        press button 'Save'
      </li>
      <li>
        press button 'OK'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The named style for the selected element type (paragraph, link, heading, 
      etc.) will be overwritten with the new settings. At the same location 
      named styles can be deleted from the style sheet too.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Deleting a named style
    </p>
    <p>
      To delete a named style
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select 'Named style...' from menu 'Format'
      </li>
      <li>
        select the named style to change settings for in the list of existing 
        named styles
      </li>
      <li>
        press button 'Delete'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Caution</b>: Deleting a named style will cause content portions 
      formatted with that style to be rendered in an unpredictable style. Be 
      sure to delete only unused styles. Keep in mind that a named style could 
      be used in another document sharing styles with the currently edited one.
