      What is SimplyHTML?
    </p>
    <p>
      As shortly described in chapter '<a href="../topic1.htm">About the 
      SimplyHTML project</a> ', SimplyHTML is an application for text 
      processing on the basis of HTML documents formatted with CSS. It 
      combines functionality of a word processor with the standards of HTML 
      and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage of the HTML and CSS standard for documents created with SimplyHTML 
      opens a wide variety of usage possibilities because many other 
      applications 'understand' and use HTML and CSS such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        web browsers
      </li>
      <li>
        other text processors
      </li>
      <li>
        presentation and graphics software
      </li>
    </ul>

      Differences of HTML and CSS in various environments
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML tries to consequently adhere to HTML and CSS standards. 
      However, there are discrepancies over different environments, which 
      sometimes can be compensated, sometimes only partly or not at all. 
      Please see chapter '<a href="../topic16/topic34/topic115.htm"> 
      Discrepancies in HTML and CSS rendering</a>' on that subject too.
