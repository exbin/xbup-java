      Incorporating plug-ins at runtime
    </p>
    <p>
      To give access to functions of external objects, SimplyHTML adds a 
      plug-in menu to its menu bar. For each plug-in one menu item is added to 
      the plug-in menu. The menu item is to be provided by the plug-in and 
      typically would contain one or more submenus with the functionality 
      delivered by the plug-in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way SimplyHTML creates a new menu item in the help menu so 
      that the plug-in can provide documentation about the way it is working.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the plug-in delivers a component to SimplyHTML, it is displayed by 
      SimplyHTML either as a new window or as a panel inside a section of 
      SimplyHTML's main window, whatever is requested by the plug-in.
