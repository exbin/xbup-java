      Inside SimplyHTML
    </p>
    <p>
      This section explains the way application SimplyHTML is built, its 
      structure, design and internal functionality. Refer to section '<a href="topic15.htm">
Using SimplyHTML</a>' to read about its usage.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Stages sections
    </p>
    <p>
      SimplyHTML is built in stages. By dividing development into pieces, it 
      is easier to concentrate on a certain detail of the application, paying 
      more attention to the particular design of this part. The application 
      will be more modular making maintenance easier to achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each stage results in a complete application. The resulting application 
      gets more complex with every stage added while retaining its modular 
      design. This section has chapters directly corresponding to each stage 
      of SimplyHTML.

    <p class="heading2">
      Source codes
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete set of source codes is distributed together with this 
      tutorial for each stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For stage 2 for instance there is a complete set of sources chapter 
      'Stage 2' refers to. This set of sources contains all sources of stage 1 
      and 2 making up one executable which - when compiled - represents stage 
      2 of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In essence, sources of stage 2 do not contain changes versus stage 1 
      only, they represent a complete application stage inlcuding previous 
      stages.

      Spotlights section
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="topic16/topic34.htm">spotlights</a> section discusses 
      certain topics from a process oriented point of view. Where the stages 
      sections explain the parts of SimplyHTML in the way they are structured 
      (by classes and methods), spotlight topics wrap several parts of the 
      application together to explain one process.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      How to use this part of the documentation
    </p>
    <p>
      This part of the tutorial should be used together with the source codes 
      which have plenty of documentation in addition. Source codes are 
      commented and most of the comments went into the API documentation 
      accompanying the package. Additional (non Javadoc) comments make clear 
      certain parts of code on top of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tutorial does not repeat code. It is structured to lead the way 
      into the very details of the application's source code by adressing 
      certain topics in one block. Chapters usually refer to the source codes 
      by naming certain fields or methods. It is recommended to open the 
      source codes in parallel to reading this tutorial.

      Target audience
    </p>
    <p>
      Basics of Java and programming in general are not covered here, so 
      interested readers should have a basic knowledge about these already. 
      This section concentrates on discussing best practices and how to's in 
      conjunction with a particular part of the application, trying to make a 
      top down approach in covering the key targets of SimplyHTML.
