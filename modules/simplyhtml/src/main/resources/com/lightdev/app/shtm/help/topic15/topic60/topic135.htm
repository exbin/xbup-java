      Working with images
    </p>
    <p>
      In line with the <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic134.htm">HTML 
      specification for image references</a>, images can be added to any 
      document of application SimplyHTML by inserting references to separate 
      image files. To insert an image
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        place the caret to the point in the document where an image shall 
        appear
      </li>
      <li>
        select 'Image...' from menu 'Insert'
      </li>
      <li>
        in the <a href="../../topic15/topic163/topic166.htm">image dialog</a> 
        press button 'Add'
      </li>
      <li>
        locate the file containing the image in the file chooser
      </li>
      <li>
        press 'OK' in the file chooser
      </li>
      <li>
        adjust attributes in the <a href="../../topic15/topic163/topic166.htm">
        image dialog</a> as needed and
      </li>
      <li>
        press 'OK' in the image dialog
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The selected image is inserted by placing a reference to the selected <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic129.htm">
image file</a> into the document. The image appears at the chosen location as 
      long as the associated image file is present in the <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic129.htm">
image repository</a>. The image repository is <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic131.htm">
created and maintained</a> by application SimplyHTML automatically. When 
      adding image files as described above, they are copied to and kept in 
      the image repository. Once an image file is present in the image 
      repository of a document, it does not have to be located in the file 
      system again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important</b>: If a document containing image references is moved to 
      another storage location by hand, the associated directory with image 
      files (the image repository, a directory named <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
images</font>) has to be moved too.

      <li>
        press 'OK' in the image dialog

      This will permanently delete the image file from the image directory of 
      the currently open document.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important</b>: When deleting an image file from the image repository, 
      all references to that image file inside the document remain intact but 
      the image is rendered as 'broken' link (broken icon picture).
