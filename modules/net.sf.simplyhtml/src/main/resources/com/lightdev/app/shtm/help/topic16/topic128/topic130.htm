      Creating a GUI to manipulate image references
    </p>
    <p>
      As with <a href="../../topic16/topic86.htm">table</a> and <a href="../../topic16/topic120.htm">
list</a> support, to create and manipulate image references a graphical user 
      interface (GUI) is needed. Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageDialog</font> is created for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Class ImageDialog
    </p>
    <p>
      Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">ImageDialog</font> 
      is used to insert image references and to set all relevant attributes 
      for these references. As well it provides a <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic129.htm">
repository</a> from which images can be selected, added and removed. An <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageDialog</font> is divided into three panels from left to right. The left 
      panel has a list which shows all files present in the image directory of 
      the given document as well as buttons to add and remove images from the 
      list. The middle panel is used as a preview region for any image 
      selected from the image list. In the right panel all attributes of a 
      selected image are shown and can be set.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Image list maintenance
    </p>
    <p>
      When an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">ImageDialog</font>
 is created, it is passed a directory which is to be used as the <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic129.htm">
image repository</a>. The image list is filled with the names of all files 
      found in this directory by calls to method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
updateFileList</font> (the method has only one line setting the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JList</font> content to the the current result of a directory listing of the 
      directory referenced by <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      imgDir</font>).
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Method handleAddImage
    </p>
    <p>
      When button 'Add' is pressed, a file chooser is opened to allow 
      selection of an image file to be placed into the repository. If a file 
      is picked in the file chooser it is copied to the image repository with 
      the help of method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic131.htm">
Util.copyFile</a></font> and method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
updateFileList</font> is called to reflect the new file in the file list.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Method handleDeleteImage
    </p>
    <p>
      When button 'Delete' is pressed, an option dialog asks the user whether 
      or not to delete the image file currently selected in the image list (if 
      any). If the user chooses to really delete the selected file, it is 
      deleted and the image list and preview are updated accordingly.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Image attribute manipulation
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an image is selected from the list of images, all attributes of the 
      selected image are displayed in the panel on the right of an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageDialog</font>. From there all attributes of the image can be set 
      accordingly. Changes to image attributes such as size or scale are 
      reflected in the preview immediately. In addition, attributes such as 
      border width or distance to the surrounding text can be set and will be 
      effective on the image in the document once applied (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      In class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">ImageDialog</font>
 a set of listeners is used to synchronize all parts of the dialog to user 
      changes of particular attributes. Section 'event handling' in the source 
      code of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">ImageDialog</font>
 has the mentioned listeners which are applied to respective components in the 
      constructor of the dialog. Each listener calls helper methods such as <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
applyPreviewHeight</font>, <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      applyPreviewWidth</font> or <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
applyPreviewScale</font> in case an event occurs which a listener is bound to.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Returning image reference and image attributes
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an image is selected and all attributes settings meet the desired 
      display in the document, method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
getImageHTML</font> returns the HTML code representing an image reference with 
      all attributes according to the selection in the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageDialog</font>. Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      getImageHTML</font> uses class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
SHTMLWriter</font> to create an image tag and attributes from the settings on 
      the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">ImageDialog</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The components on the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      ImageDialog</font> used for setting image attributes are implementing 
      the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">AttributeComponent</font>
 interface so each of them returns its value in an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
AttributeSet</font> object. All such settings are brought together in an 
      instance of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      SimpleAttributeSet</font> and passed to method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
startTag</font> of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      SHTMLWriter</font> along with the actual image reference returned by 
      method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">getImageSrc</font>
       .
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Setting an initial image reference and attributes
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides creating new image references class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageDialog</font> can be used to display and manipulate an existing image 
      reference too. The same functionality is used as described above after 
      the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">ImageDialog</font> 
      has been set to an existing image reference with method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
setImageAttributes</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">setImageAttributes</font>
 iterates through the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">Vector</font>
 of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">AttributeComponents</font> 
      and applies attributes from a given <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
AttributeSet</font> to the components. As well it sets the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImagePreview</font> to the image reference found in the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
AttributeSet</font>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Image preview
    </p>
    <p>
      When an image is selected from the list of images or when attributes af 
      a selected image are changed, the resulting image as it would appear in 
      the document is shown in the preview section of class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImageDialog</font>. The preview is produced by class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImagePreview</font> which is an extension to class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JComponent</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">ImagePreview</font>
       takes care of displaying any image and has methods to apply a given 
      scale percentage to that image. It implements the <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
Scrollable</font> interface so it can be embedded in a <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
JScrollPane</font> for cases where an image is to be viewed in a region being 
      smaller than respective image.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can refer to the source code of <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
ImagePreview</font> for more details about how the preview of images is 
      achieved.
