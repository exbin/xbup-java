      Style handling design in SimplyHTML
    </p>
    <p>
      Java implements class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      StyleSheet</font> to define central styles in <a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic42.htm">
CSS</a> notation for an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      HTMLDocument</font>. In addition styles in <a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic42.htm">
CSS</a> syntax can be included directly in <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
HTMLDocuments</font> by storing them as an attribute to a HTML tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all Java versions up to J2SE 1.4 there is no way however, to store 
      styles persistently although working with <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
HTMLDocuments</font> in Java would hardly work without styles. Applications 
      creating <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">HTMLDocuments</font>
 have to find a way to save styles on their own. SimplyHTML defines and uses 
      an own class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace"><a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic48.htm">
CSSWriter</a></font> for this matter.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      When are styles saved?
    </p>
    <p>
      In stage 1 of application SimplyHTML styles can not be changed, so a 
      style sheet is only <a href="../../../topic16/topic4/topic25/topic47.htm">
saved</a>, when a newly created document is saved (i.e. the document was not 
      loaded from a file and a style sheet with the same name does not exist 
      at the target location for the document).
    </p>
    <p>
      This leaves one conflict open:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a style sheet exists at the location where a new document is to be 
        saved and
      </li>
      <li>
        the exisiting style sheet has the same name as the style sheet 
        associated with the new document to be saved and
      </li>
      <li>
        the exisiting style sheet is different from the style sheet associated 
        with the new document
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this case, the style sheet is not saved and the existing style sheet 
      is used. A solution for this case is not implemented in SimplyHTML yet. 
      A workaround for the time being is to save newly created documents in a 
      directory which holds only documents sharing the default style sheet of 
      SimplyHTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      In later stages of SimplyHTML it will be possible to change styles. Then 
      the association of style sheets and documents as well as the handling of 
      saving style sheets will be refined.
