      Changing paragraph styles
    </p>
    <p>
      As opposed to <a href="../../topic15/topic60/topic85.htm">styles applied 
      to single characters</a>, paragraph styles are a way to define a group 
      of formatting settings for one or more paragraphs at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set the style for one or more paragraphs
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select the paragraph(s) to be formatted in the editor
      </li>
      <li>
        choose 'Paragraph...' in menu 'Format'
      </li>
      <li>
        set formatting options accordingly and
      </li>
      <li>
        press 'OK'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All contents of the selected paragraph(s) will assume the settings 
      formatted in the Paragraph Style Dialog accordingly, unless other 
      individual styles have been set for single characters inside the 
      respective paragraph(s).
