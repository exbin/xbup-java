      Documenting the application
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing and developing an application can be hard work already. But 
      the resulting solution is nothing without proper documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Documentation starts at providing information about the name of the 
      application or license and copyright notices and goes all the way 
      through installation guidelines to a user manual, tutorial and 
      information for developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the time, documenting an application is at least as much the 
      work as developing it. This section shall give some hints about how a 
      proper documentation can be accomplished.
