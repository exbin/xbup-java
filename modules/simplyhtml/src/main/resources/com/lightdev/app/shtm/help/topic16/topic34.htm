      While most functions of SimplyHTML are explained from the perspective of 
      the structure in the source code by explaining certain methods or 
      classes, for some functionality it makes sense to view it from a rather 
      process oriented perspective.

    <p>
      In this section, such cases are explained in the process context, 
      wrapping together several functions located at different places but 
      belonging to a particular process. As well topics are reflected which do 
      belong to certain part or class of SimplyHTML but rather should be 
      explained in more general context.
