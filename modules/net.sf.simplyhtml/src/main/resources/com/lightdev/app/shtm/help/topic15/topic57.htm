      A new tab in the main frame of SimplyHTML will be opened with a new 
      empty and untitled document to work with. All other open documents 
      remain open which is indicated by respective tabs identifying other open 
      documents. The display switches to the newly created document with its 
      tab on top.

      Using an existing style sheet for new documents
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually a reference between a document and a style sheet containing 
      named styles is only created when named styles are added to a document 
      explicitly. In cases where a new document shall use an existing style 
      sheet which was previously created for another document, option 'Link 
      new documents with default style sheet' has to be set in the <a href="../topic15/topic163/topic167.htm">
options dialog</a>.
