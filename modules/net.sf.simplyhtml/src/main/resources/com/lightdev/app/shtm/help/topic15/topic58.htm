      Saving documents
    </p>
    <p>
      To save a document, it has to be visible as the currently edited 
      document. To save this document
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select 'Save' from menu 'File'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The document will be saved at the location it was openend from. If 
      respective document was newly created and thus not saved so far, you 
      will be prompted for a location and file name for the document as with 
      saving a document under a different name (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Important</b>: You have to enter a file name including extension 
      (.htm or .html). The extension will not be completed by the application 
      if it was omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: Documents are opened using the HTML version set in the <a href="../topic15/topic163/topic167.htm">
options dialog</a>. Unless set otherwise, HTML 3.2 is used as the default.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Image directory
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with the document file, an <a href="../topic15/topic60/topic135.htm">
image directory</a> is created with any image file referenced in the saved 
      document.
    </p>
    <p class="heading3">
      Style sheet maintenance
    </p>
    <p>
      If <a href="../topic15/topic60/topic139.htm">named styles were created 
      or changed</a> for a document, a style sheet will be created during the 
      save process if none is already present. If a style sheet with the same 
      name is found at the target location, it is <a href="../topic16/topic140/topic150.htm">
merged</a> with the style sheet to be saved. Instead of defining named styles 
      for a document and merging them with an existing style sheet, a new 
      document can also use an existing style sheet right away. See '<a href="../topic15/topic57.htm">
Creating new documents</a>' and chapter '<a href="../topic15/topic163/topic167.htm">
Options dialog</a>' for an explanation about this option.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Caution</b>: An existing style sheet with the same name could have 
      styles with the same name as altered ones in the saved style sheet. 
      Overwriting such styles could cause unwanted styles to appear in other 
      documents sharing the particular style sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore you should consider to either
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        not save documents in the same directory when they do not share the 
        same set of named styles or
      </li>
      <li>
        use different style names for different styles over all documents 
        sharing the same style sheet
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="heading2">
      Saving a document under a different name
    </p>
    <p>
      To save a document under a different name or at a different location 
      than where it has been openend from
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        select 'Save as...' from menu 'File'
      </li>
      <li>
        choose a new location and/or new file name and
      </li>
      <li>
        press 'Save'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Respective document again has to be visible as the currently edited 
      document.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document will be saved at the chosen location under the given file 
      name. The original document remains intact at the original location but 
      SimplyHTML switches the current document to be the newly saved one so 
      subsequent save operations go to that file unless explicitly changed 
      again.
