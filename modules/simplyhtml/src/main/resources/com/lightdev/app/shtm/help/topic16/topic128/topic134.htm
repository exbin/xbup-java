      Image references in HTML
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML images are separated from documents. Documents contain 
      references to image files in the place where images should appear inside 
      a document. An image reference describes the location and name of 
      respective image file as well as how it is to be rendered. The actual 
      images are stored separately in image files and loaded dynamically when 
      documents are displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      An image reference in HTML is expressed by an <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
img</font> tag having the reference attribute and additional attributes such 
      as in
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">&lt;img 
      src=&quot;images/picture.jpg&quot; border=0 width=100 height=200&gt;</font>

    </p>
    <p>
      The image reference attribute (attribute <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
src</font>) can be either an absolute or relative path and file name 
      expression. The other attributes specify information about how the image 
      is to be displayed such as image width and height or how much space 
      between text and image is to be rendered.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Absolute references
    </p>
    <p>
      An absolute reference is an expression containig the full path and name 
      of an image file such as in
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      file:/C:/data/documents/myDoc/images/picture.jpg</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute image references should be avoided as they need to be changed 
      whenever the image file is moved to another location.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Relative references
    </p>
    <p>
      A relative reference has path and file name information relative to the 
      location a HTML document is stored. An expression such as
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">images/picture.jpg</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      inside a document stored as
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
      c:\data\document\myDoc\doc.htm</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      would mean the same as the absolute reference expression from previous 
      paragraph. The main difference however is that whenever the document and 
      image file are moved to a new location together, the relative reference 
      can remain unchanged.
    </p>
    <p class="heading2">
      Resolving relative references
    </p>
    <p>
      In SimplyHTML's implementation of image support only relative references 
      are used. To resolve relative image references, class <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
HTMLDocument</font> allows to specify a base location with method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
setBase</font>. When a document is loaded, its source path is passed to method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
setBase</font> as the the base directory. When a new document is created, a <a href="../../topic16/topic128/topic129.htm">
temporary directory</a> is set with method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
setBase</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both cases all relative references are resolved against the base 
      directory set with method <font face="'Courier New',Monospaced,Monospace">
setBase</font>.
    </p>
