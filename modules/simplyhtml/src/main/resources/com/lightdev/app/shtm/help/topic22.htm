      Getting started
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright, you somehow found this tutorial, made it through lots of 
      preliminary information about SimplyHTML and finally like to use it 
      somehow. Thank you! And here is how it works:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        find out, if you meet the <a href="topic22/topic6.htm">requirements</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        make sure, download and <a href="topic22/topic23.htm">installation</a> 
        is complete (yes, you have to do it without fancy installers, but hey, 
        relax: it is simple, even I can do it...)
      </li>
      <li>
        and off you go by <a href="topic22/topic52.htm">starting the 
        application</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Seriously you should at least be familiar with this part of the 
      documentation before you try to use SimplyHTML.
